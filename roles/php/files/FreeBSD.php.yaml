# This value sets the installed default php version.
# The value "php" refers to the latest available stable version.
# If you want to install another version like from https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php
# you have to add the repository first as described in that projects introduction.
# Then you can set a specific php version e.g. "php7.4".
# If you are looking to install additional versions (multiPHP), this has to be done manually.
#
# When removing an extension you need to manually remove it from your system too.
# pkg remove php-<extension>
